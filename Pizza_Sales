Data Retrieval with SQL: The video likely shows how to query a database using SQL to extract relevant data about pizza sales. This could involve selecting specific columns, filtering rows based on certain criteria (using WHERE clauses), and aggregating data (using GROUP BY and aggregate functions like SUM or COUNT).

Data Analysis: Once the data is retrieved, the video may demonstrate how to analyze it to gain insights into pizza sales trends. This could include identifying top-selling pizza varieties, analyzing sales trends over time, comparing sales across different regions or stores, and identifying patterns or correlations in the data.

Data Visualization with Power BI: After analyzing the data, the video likely shows how to create visualizations using Power BI to present the findings in an easy-to-understand format. This could involve creating charts (such as bar charts, line charts, or pie charts) to visualize sales trends, creating maps to show sales distribution geographically, and creating interactive dashboards to allow users to explore the data dynamically.

Dashboard Design: The video may also cover best practices for designing effective dashboards in Power BI. This could include tips for choosing appropriate visualizations, arranging visual elements for clarity and readability, adding interactivity to allow users to drill down into the data, and incorporating branding or styling to make the dashboard visually appealing.

Overall, the video likely provides a practical demonstration of how to use SQL and Power BI to analyze and visualize pizza sales data, with the goal of uncovering insights that can inform business decisions.
